## Notice: You need to get the Firebase API keys from me.

Email me at hunter.white1801@gmail.com

Not having API keys will result in the app loading a blank screen and/or errors.

# Getting Started:

To get started, follow these steps:

1. run `npm install`.
2. `cd` into `functions` and run `npm install`.
3. While in the `functions` folder make a `.env` file that has a varriable called STRIPE_KEY with the stripe key I gave you.
4. Go back to the `/src` directory and create a file called `firebaseKeys.ts` and enter the firebase keys I gave you.
5. You should now be able to run `npm start`
